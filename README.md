# StackLL
Implement a stack class using both a linked list and an array (assume a max size of 100 nodes). A test program that adds a few nodes and then tests each of the stack functions follows:
TestStackA.java
TestStackLL.java
The output should be:
StackOutput.txt
In addition, the printStack method for both stacks follows:
printStack.txt
